## Overview

Publishing a transactable offer in the Azure Marketplace is a multi-step process that involves planning, gathering information, and publishing the offer. The process can be outlined in the following stages:

1. **Understanding the SaaS offer**: - During this stage, you will need to understand the SaaS offer type and the technical requirements for the offer. You will work with a Microsoft representative to understand the overall process and the requirements to go ahead with publishing a SaaS offer.

2. **Gathering information**: Publishing a SaaS offer involves gathering information about the offer, including the offer details, completing the technical requirements, and creating the offer in Partner Center. 

3. **Publishing the offer**: Once you all the information available, you can procced with creating a _Software as a Service (SaaS)_ offer in Partner Center.

4. **Offer validation**: After submitting the offer, it will go through the automated validation process and will be available in _Preview_ stage. During this stage, only the pre-defined users will be able to see this offer in the Azure Marketplace and/or AppSource and will be able to test the end-to-end flow.

5. **Go-live**: After the validation is satisfactory, you can click the _Go Live_ button to make the offer available to all the customers in the Azure Marketplace and/or AppSource.

## Understanding the SaaS offer

The SaaS offer type in Azure Marketplace is meant for software publishers who want to offer their software as a service to customers. In this model, the publisher hosts the software and the customer accesses it over the internet. The customer pays a subscription fee to access the software which implicitly includes the cloud cost and the solution cost. The customer does not have to worry about the infrastructure or the software maintenance. The publisher is responsible for the software updates and the infrastructure maintenance as well as bearing the hosting costs.

Another important aspect that you need to understand is the transactional capabilities availble in Azure Marketplace. Following is a high-level overview of how you can transact through the Azure Marketplace:

**Pricing model**: The pricing model for SaaS offer can be either a flat rate or per-user basis. While this sounds oversimplified, the pricing model can be more complex and can include multiple pricing tiers, metered billing, or a combination of both.
- Per-user pricing: When you select this pricing model, you can set the _per user_ price for your plans. The customer will be billed based on the number of users they have subscribed for automatically by the Azure Marketplace.
- Flat rate pricing: When you select this pricing model, you can set the _flat rate_ price for your plans. This option is suitable for solutions that do not fit the per-user pricing model. Selecting this model also allows you to make use of the _metered billing_ capabilities. You can add custom dimensions to your plan to bill the customers on a more granular basis. Custom dimensions also allow you to bill the customers on frequencies other than monthly or yearly.

The SaaS Accelerator provides a reference integration with _Metered Billing APIs_ to facilitate the metered billing capabilities. You can refer to the [SaaS Accelerator on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/Commercial-Marketplace-SaaS-Accelerator) for more information.
