## Overview

Before you can receive payment for your incentive programs for a particular Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location, you must complete your enrollment by associating a valid payout and tax profile with the program and Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program location. Microsoft uses that payout and tax profile to issue payments. You might be allowed to use an electronic bank transfer or a credit note for payment, depending on the rules of the incentive program.

Please follow the steps as mentioned in the below document for setting up the Tax and Payout Profile:
